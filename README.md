# my Arch Linux installation notes
Notes for my system build up, with all my software installation steps and most of my configurations, minus a few private settings.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:harriott/ArchBuilds.git
git clone https://github.com/harriott/ArchBuilds.git
```

## Why Arch?
[Arch Linux](https://harriott.github.io/2023/02/11/Arch_Linux.html)

## some platforms I use
- a self-build around a `Gigabyte GA-970A-DS3P` motherboard
- an `Asus VivoBook W202`
- an old Lenovo ThinkCentre M58 (Type 7637)
